<br>
<h4>Concept / Topic To Teach:</h4>
<p>It is always a good practice to scrub all input, especially those inputs that will later be used as parameters to OS commands, scripts, and database queries. It is particularly important for content that will be permanently stored somewhere in the application. Users should not be able to create message content that could cause another user to load an undesireable page or undesireable content when the user's message is retrieved. </p>

<h4>General Goal(s):</h4>
<p>
The user should be able to add message content that cause another user to load an undesireable page or content. </p>
