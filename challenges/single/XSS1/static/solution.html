<h3>Solution</h3>

<p>Enter any 3 digit number in PIN and you will notice that the transaction is successful. If you enter anything other than 3 digit number, an error message is displayed "Sorry, the pin 'xxxx' is Invalid". The pin that you have entered is reflected in the output without any escaping. Now try to enter something like <em><strong>&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;</strong></em></p>

<p>The script that you enter will be executed.</p>
