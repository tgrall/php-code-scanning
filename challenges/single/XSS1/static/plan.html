<h3 class="text-center">Title: Reflected Cross Site Scripting</h3>
<br>
<h4>Concept / Topic To Teach:</h4>
<p>It is always a good practice to validate all input on the server side. XSS can occur when unvalidated user input is used in an HTTP response. In a reflected XSS attack, an attacker can craft a URL with the attack script and post it to another website, email it, or otherwise get a victim to click on it. </p>

<h4>General Goal(s):</h4>
<p>
For this exercise, your mission is to come up with some input containing a script. You have to try to get this page to reflect that input back to your browser, which will execute the script and do something bad. </p>
