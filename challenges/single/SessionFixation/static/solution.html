<h4>Stage 2:</h4>
<p>Now you are Jane which receives the mail you wrote in stage 1. Point with the mouse on the link and you will notice the SID in the status bar of your browser. This is the easiest stage as you have only to click on the link 'Goat Hills Financial'.</p>

<h4>Stage 3:</h4>
<p>You are on the login screen of Goat Financial Hills now. In the URL the <strong>SID</strong> is also visible. All you have to do is to log in with your user name <em>Jane</em> and your password <em>tarzan</em></p>

<h4>Stage 4:</h4>
<p>Now Jane has logged into her account, you have to steal her session. You are hacker Joe, click on the link 'Bank Login' to go back to login page.</p>

<h4>Stage 5:</h4>
<p>After having clicked on the provied link you reach login screen. Take a look at the URL and you will see that your SID is NOTVALID. Change this string to the SID you have chosen at the beginning of this lesson and hit enter.</p>
