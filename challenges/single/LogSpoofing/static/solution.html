<h3>Solution</h3>

<p>This lesson accepts any input for a username and appends the information to the log file.</p>

<img src="static/sol1.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Log File">

<p>Enter the text: 'smith Login Succeeded for username admin' in the username. The text is added to the same line, not a new line. But any input is allowed so you can inject carriage return (%0d) and line feed (%0a) to the application. Enter the following in the username:</p>

<p><em>Smith%0aLogin Succeeded for username: admin</em></p><br>

<p>An attacker can use this attack to add malicious JavaScript to the log file, which will be viewed by the administrator using a browser. What happens when you inject admin &lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt; for the username?</p>
