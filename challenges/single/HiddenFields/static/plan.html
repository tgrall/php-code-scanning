<h3 class="text-center">Title: Exploiting Hidden Fields</h3>
<br>
<h4>Concept / Topic To Teach:</h4>
<p>Developers will use hidden fields for tracking, login, pricing, etc. information on a loaded page. While this is a convenient and easy mechanism for the developer, they often don't validate the information that is received from the hidden field. This lesson will teach the attacker to find and modify hidden fields to obtain a product for a price other than the price specified</p>

<h4>General Goal(s):</h4>
<p>The user should be able to exploit a hidden field to obtain a product at an incorrect price. Try to purchase the HDTV for less than the purchase price, if you have not done so already.</p>
