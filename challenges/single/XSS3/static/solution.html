<h3>Solution</h3>

<p>This lesson is using JavaScript hash based navigation. i.e the image that is displayed is based on the number after the hash in the url. View the source code of the page and look at the source of 'image.js' which contains the code for navigation.</p>

<img src="static/sol1.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Source Code">

<p>Any value that you will supply in the url after the hash will be concatenated with the img tag and the new tag is placed inside the div. You can inject a DOM element of your own by crafting the url. For example : <em>3.jpg'/&gt;&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(1)&gt;</em> will append another img tag by which an arbitary JavaScript code can be executed.</p>
