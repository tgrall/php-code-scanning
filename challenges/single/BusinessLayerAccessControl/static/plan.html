<h3 class="text-center">Title: Business Layer Access Control</h3>
<br>
<h4>Concept / Topic To Teach:</h4>
<p>In role-based access control scheme, a role represents a set of access permissions and privileges. A user can be assigned one or more roles. A role-based access control normally consists of two parts: role permission management and role assignment. A broken role-based access control scheme might allow a user to perform accesses that are not allowed by his/her assigned roles, or somehow obtain unauthorized roles. </p>

<h4>General Goal(s):</h4>
<p>Your goal is to explore the access control rules that govern this site. Each role has permission to certain resources (A-F). Each user is assigned one or more roles. Only the user with the [Admin] role should have access to the 'F' resources. In a successful attack, a user doesn't have the [Admin] role can access resource F.</p>
