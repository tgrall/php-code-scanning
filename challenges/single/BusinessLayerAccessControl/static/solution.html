<h3>Solution</h3>
<br>
<p>To solve this exercise you have to know the name of the action, which deletes employees. Of course you could just guess it because it has a really logical name. But we will look it up. So your first step is to log in as 'John' with 'john' as password. Use a proxy to intercept the delete request. As you can see the delete action is called 'DeleteProfile'. Now log in as Tom. Click in the list on his name and make sure the proxy will intercept the next request. Click on a button, for example the 'ViewProfile' button. Change in WebScarab the action to 'DeleteProfile'</p>
