<h3 class="text-center">Title: Using Access Control Matrix</h3>
<br>
<h4>Concept / Topic To Teach:</h4>
<p>
In a role-based access control scheme, a role represents a set of access permissions and privileges. A user can be assigned one or more roles. A role-based access control scheme normally consists of two parts: role permission management and role assignment. A broken role-based access control scheme might allow a user to perform accesses that are not allowed by his/her assigned roles, or somehow allow privilege escalation to an unauthorized role. </p>
<h4>General Goal(s):</h4>
<p>Each user is a member of a role that is allowed to access only certain resources. Your goal is to explore the access control rules that govern this site. Only the [Admin] group should have access to the 'Account Manager' resource. </p>
