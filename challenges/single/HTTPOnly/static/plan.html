<h3 class="text-center">Title: HTTPOnly Test</h3>
<br>
<h4>Concept / Topic To Teach:</h4>
<p> To help mitigate the cross site scripting threat, Microsoft has introduced a new cookie attribute entitled 'HttpOnly.' If this flag is set, then the browser should not allow client-side script to access the cookie. Since the attribute is relatively new, several browsers neglect to handle the new attribute properly.</p>

<h4>General Goal(s):</h4>
<p> The purpose of this lesson is to test whether your browser supports the HTTPOnly cookie flag. Note the value of the unique2u cookie.</p>
