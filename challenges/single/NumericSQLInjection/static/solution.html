<p>The application is taking the input from the select box and inserting it at the end of a pre-formed SQL command. Compound SQL statements can be made by joining multiple tests with keywords like AND and OR. Try appending a SQL statement that always resolves to true.</p>

<p>This is the query: <em>SELECT * FROM weather_data WHERE station = 1</em></p>

<p>Intercept the post request with a proxy and replace 1 with 1 or 1=1</p>

<p>As the SQL Statement is true for every station you get a list of all stations.</p>
