================

OWASP WebGoatPHP is a port of OWASP WebGoat to PHP and MySQL/SQLite databases. The goal is to create an interactive teaching environment for web application security by offering lessons in the form of challenges. In each challenge the user must exploit the vulnerability to demonstrate their understanding.

WebGoatPHP supports four different modes i.e single mode, workshop mode, contest mode and secure coding mode.

### Adding a lesson/challenge
Adding a new challenge is very simple. All the challenges must be present in 'challenges' directory and must extend class 'BaseLesson'. A template is provided in template/SampleLesson. The name of the directory must be same as the name of the class in index.php. Any static content like images, scripts etc. must be placed inside a sub-directory 'static' within the lesson directory.

There are few methods which your lesson need to implement like start(), getTitle(), getCategory(), reset() etc.

Once you have added the lesson click on "Refresh List" button at the top of the application to display your lesson in the list.
